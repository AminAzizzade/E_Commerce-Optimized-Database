# 🚀 E-Commerce Database Project  

📌 **Today's e-commerce giants operate with large and complex data structures.**  
In this project, I analyzed the data models of **Amazon, Trendyol, and HepsiBurada**, and developed an **optimized, scalable, and unified relational database model**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals  

✅ **Analysis of Existing Systems** – Reviewed the data requirements of Amazon, Trendyol, and HepsiBurada, identifying **common and platform-specific features**.  

✅ **EER Diagrams** – Created detailed **Entity-Relationship (EER) models** for each platform.  

✅ **Unified and Optimized Model** – Merged shared data structures into a **scalable and modular** unified model.  

✅ **SQL Implementation** – Developed the final model as a **relational database schema using DDL (Data Definition Language) scripts**.  

✅ **Testing and Sample Data** – Added **sample datasets** and executed queries for realistic testing scenarios.

## 📊 Database Design  

### 🔍 1️⃣ Platform-Based Analysis  

Main components identified through detailed analysis for each platform:

- 👥 **Users** (Customers & Sellers)  
- 🛍️ **Product & Inventory Management**  
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart System**  
- 📦 **Orders & Order Items**  
- 💳 **Payments & Promotions**  
- 🚚 **Shipping & Logistics Management**  
- ⭐ **Reviews & Ratings**

### 📌 2️⃣ EER Diagrams  

Separate **EER diagrams** were created for each platform:  
[All Tables PDF](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AminAzizzade/E_Commerce-Optimized-Database/main/docs/AllTabless.pdf)

- 📄 [Amazon EER](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AminAzizzade/E_Commerce-Optimized-Database/main/docs/Amazon_EER.pdf)  
- 📄 [Trendyol EER](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AminAzizzade/E_Commerce-Optimized-Database/main/docs/Trendyol_EER.pdf)  
- 📄 [HepsiBurada EER](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AminAzizzade/E_Commerce-Optimized-Database/main/docs/HepsiBurada_EER.pdf)  

🔍 **Goal:** Analyze **similarities and differences** in the data models of each platform.

### 🔄 3️⃣ Unified Optimized EER Model  

Common features from Amazon, Trendyol, and HepsiBurada were **combined into a single unified model**.  
Unique structures were preserved to create a **flexible and scalable** design.

📄 **Fully Integrated Model:** [ECommerceCombined_EER.pdf](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AminAzizzade/E_Commerce-Optimized-Database/main/docs/ECommerceCombined_EER.pdf)  

---

### 🛠️ 4️⃣ SQL Implementation  

The EER model was converted into a relational database schema and **coded using DDL commands**.

📜 **SQL Scripts:**  
- 🏗️ [Create Tables](sql/create_tables.sql) → **Contains table definitions and constraints.**  
- 📊 [Insert Sample Data](sql/insert_sample_data.sql) → **Provides sample data for testing.**
